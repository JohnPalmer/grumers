grumers
======================

Introduction
------------

Django project that uses `geodjango <http://geodjango.org/>`_ to recollect data of Jellyfish observations (grumers in catalan).

It is composed by two apps: grumers.apps.data and grumers.apps.web, where 'data' is the main application, containing models, forms and views that manage jellyfish observations. The 'web' application is a reusable and very basic CMS app to build the website (on top of flatplages and django-mptt).
